          <p class="intro">
            Legacy ERPs were designed to be sold, not to be used. They're slow to adapt, painful to customise, and charge extra for every module, every user, every update. We build lean, modern ERP systems for SMEs that need real tools &mdash; not a vendor's idea of what a business should look like.

              We start by understanding exactly where your current system is slowing your people down &mdash; the manual workarounds, the missing integrations, the reports that take a day to pull. Then we build around that reality, not a template.
